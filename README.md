# Docu-Dive
Docu-Dive is a full-stack multi-document-search web-app by utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques to get the most out of Generative AI LLMs. I used React.js for the frontend, and Python, Langchain, AWS Bedrock, ChromaDB, and FastAPI for the backend. I used Docker to containerize the frontend and backend, AWS ECR to store the Docker images, and AWS EC2 to run the containers, with Nginx configured on EC2 to manage traffic and SSL/TLS certificates for secure access.
